# Introduction

Welcome to the Hotels For Hope API! You can use our API to access Hotels For Hope API endpoints, which can get information on hundreds of thousands of hotels, their availability, details, as well as create and cancel reservations.

We have examples using a shell. You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and (when languages become available) you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.
