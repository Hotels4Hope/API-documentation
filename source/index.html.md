# Introduction

Welcome to the Hotels For Hope API! You can use our API to access Hotels For Hope API endpoints, which can get information on hundreds of thousands of hotels, their availability, details, as well as create and cancel reservations.

We have language bindings in Shell, Ruby, Python, and JavaScript! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

This example API documentation page was created with [Slate](https://github.com/slatedocs/slate). Feel free to edit it and use it as a base for your own API's documentation.

# Authentication

Hotels For Hope uses a querystring username and password to allow access to the API. You can request Hotels For Hope API credentials by partnering with us and emailing [support](mailto:hello@hotelsforhope.com).

The API credentials are expected in all API requests to the server in the querystring like the following:

`&username=API-USERNAME&password=API-PASSWORD`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>API-USERNAME</code>, <code>API-PASSWORD</code>, and <code>SITEID</code> with your personal API credentials and Site ID.

# Hotels

## Availability Search

This endpoint retrieves all hotels which have availability for the dates and locations (or individual hotels) specified.

Make this request for the total number of rooms and the total number of guests.  The response will return a maximum of 50 hotels per request, thus you must use pagination techniques if you need more than 50. That said, 50 is the maximum but may not be the best performing. Use smaller batches to get faster responses.

Responses will contain available rate plans and room types from various suppliers we call "gateways".

Responses may contain full nightly rates and tax information, only first night rates with or without tax information, or the highest or average nightly rate.  This response depends on the supplier/gateway but the most common from most gateways is the first night's rate, thus the property name in our responses (`FirstNightRate`).

Rates are always returned in the hotel's native currency.  If you request another `currency`, the correct conversion rate from the hotel's native currency to the desired `DisplayCurrency` will be returned as `DisplayCurrencyMultiplier`. You may use this value to convert the hotel currency to the desired currency for display in your UI. This allows you to show both the original currency and display currency side by side.

<aside class="notice">
We do not advise programming in a gateway-specific manner. Gateways may respond with varying amounts of information at any time. Also, new gateways could be added at any time.
</aside>

<aside class="notice">
If an availability search fails to return rates, we suggest not showing the hotel in your user interface.

## Hotel Detail

This call confirms availability with the supplier / gateway (requests to skip any caching they have in place) and retrieves cancellation and booking policies to display prior to the user placing a reservation.

This call is only available for a single hotel ID, room code, and rate code.

Responses will contain nightly rates, taxes and fees associated with the room, and hotel, payment, and cancellation policies which apply to the rate.

This request is rate limited as it is an expensive request to make. Responses with a 429 status code are in response to over use, should you exceed the rate limit. 

Failed responses indicate the rate is sold out. Subsequent availability calls will flush and re-cache this hotel's rates.

**All fees, penalties, and policies from this response must be shown to the user before creating a reservation.**

All room prices are based on the number of adults per room specified in the request.  A response containing an extra adult fee of `0` may simply mean the pricing is not available. Adding more than the specified number of adults to the room because the extra adult fee is `0` will likely incur a price difference when the guest arrives at the hotel. To avoid this, we advise not depend on the extra adult fee specified in the response when it comes to pricing.
